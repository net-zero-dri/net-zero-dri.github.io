title: Providing expertise on sustainable computing
permalink: /sustainable-computing/

Glasgow University provided expertise on advances in computing science, software engineering and hardware technology supporting the goal of low-carbon and sustainable computing. They also provide links to the EPSRC user community.
They assisted and contributed to the literature survey and developing the roadmap itself - both by contributing to workshops and engaging with the project to guide the evidence gathering process (e.g. via interviews with EPSRC funded facilities managers.)

This consortium activity also looked to answer three questions: (i) Relative importance of emissions resulting from UKRI funded research but not directly attributable to facilities, (ii) Impact of the software on emissions and (iii) What technologies could make a dramatic difference in 20 years (horizon scanning). <br>
A summary of this work can be found in the final technical report.
