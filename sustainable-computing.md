Glasgow University will provide expertise on advances in computing science, software engineering and hardware technology supporting the goal of low-carbon and sustainable computing. They will also provide links to the EPSRC user community.
They will assist and contribute to the literature survey and developing the roadmap itself - both by contributing to workshops and engaging with the project to guide the evidence gathering process (e.g. via interviews with EPSRC funded facilities managers.)
