[JASMIN](https://jasmin.ac.uk/), operated by [STFC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/) on behalf of [NERC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/), is the UKâ€™s data analysis facility for environmental science, providing both compute and storage facilities for data-intensive research. It is a highly versatile infrastructure supporting over 1500 users exploring a wide range of topics in environmental science and engaged in a variety of workflows. 

Interviews were held with managers of these facilities, based on a structured script, to explore the current concerns and future expectations of the facility managers with respect to Net Zero, and to draw conclusions and recommendations of general relevance and validity to Net Zero and DRI. As per the project plan, another goal was to inform the design of the database of UKRI DRI, and there was a strong interaction between the two lines of work.
