This page details all the information about the work going on to create our net zero roadmap. 
We've partnered with 19 institutions to carry out proof-of-concept studies and workshops as well as funding case studies undertaken by our Consortium. These avenues of research will combine with our literature review and stakeholder engagement to produce a successful final report.
