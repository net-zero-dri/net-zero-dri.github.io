### IRISCAST = IRIS Carbon Audit SnapshoT

[DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7692451](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7692451)

**What's the scope of this work?**

Making good decisions around infrastructure procurement and provision requires understanding, as much as possible, the full carbon costs for operating, maintaining, and using the infrastructure; going beyond accounting for electricity and cooling, and including the full chain of costs embodied in the infrastructure. Enabling good decision making therefore requires a source of accurate real-world data on infrastructure climate impacts. <br>

IRISCAST set out to identify where the carbon cost sits across a large multi-site infrastructure including the embodied carbon costs of both infrastructure (such as computers and data storage devices) and housing (such as data centre buildings and equipment).

A carbon audit was conducted during a 24-hour snapshot period of various Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) assets. Gathering inventories, energy usage and other data across 6 heterogeneous facilities, IRISCAST has been able to model the carbon costs of the facilities that were snapshot and also develop a carbon model and methods to gather the data. <br>

In order to engage the community, two workshops were undertaken to conduct the audit and then to interpret and communicate the findings.
