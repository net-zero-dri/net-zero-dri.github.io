The UKRI Net Zero DRI Scoping Project is collecting robust evidence and formulating recommendations that ensure we can provide carbon neutral computing and data services for the research and innovation communities. We have funded research with a diverse group of researchers that will enable us to create an evidenced roadmap to achieve net zero for the UKRI's DRI by 2040.
