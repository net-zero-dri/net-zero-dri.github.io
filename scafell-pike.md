[Scafell Pike](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Our-systems-and-platforms.aspx) is an STFC facility that is listed in the Top500 and Green500 lists of global supercomputers. Scafell Pike supports modelling and simulation for engineering, computational chemistry, physics and some life sciences work.

Interviews were held with managers of these facilities, based on a structured script, to explore the current concerns and future expectations of the facility managers with respect to Net Zero, and to draw conclusions and recommendations of general relevance and validity to Net Zero and DRI. 
As per the project plan, another goal was to inform the design of the database of UKRI DRI, and there was a strong interaction between the two lines of work.
