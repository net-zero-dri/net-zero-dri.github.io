**Whatâ€™s the scope of this work?** <br>
This project will provide a measurement trace that captures the sustainability aspects in the operation of a DRI service, including dependencies between different indicators (e.g. data flow, power consumption, and carbon intensity). 

This will answer questions such as: <br>
- How does variability in the utilisation of infrastructure translate to energy consumption?
- Which are the indicators that minimise uncertainty of associated carbon footprints?
- How does the varying grid carbon intensity affect carbon footprints, and can this be exploited to reduce emissions?

By leveraging end-to-end data from the partners,this project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of service-level quantification of carbon footprints.
