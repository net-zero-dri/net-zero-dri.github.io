\section{The Challenge of Negative Abatement Costs}

Surrey going net-zero (scopes 1 \& 2) by 2030\cite{oflynn2021}

A negative abatement cost refers to the cost of modifying a process which delivers a cost savings. As pointed out by \cite{elkins2011}, this represents a kind of market failure. Simple economic models assume that processes will automatically adjust to the most economically beneficial cost. 

For example, \cite{ukse-site} has a calculator which indicates a saving of 2.4m GBP over 16 years for a deal to buy 8GwH per year (roughly the usage of ARCHER -- needs confirmation)

Finding ways to reduce carbon emissions and save money at the same time is good for the budget, but poses a policy challenge: why have these measures not been implemented.
