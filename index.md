title: The Net Zero Digital Research Infrastructure Scoping Project
permalink: /index/
---

[UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/) (UKRI) is committed to becoming **net zero by 2040**. Across our nine organisations, there are an extensive range of computers and peripherals - known as [digital research infrastructure (DRI)](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/). 

To support this goal, given the need and value of DRI, a scoping project funded by UKRI has been awarded **Â£1.8 million** to investigate how UKRI can achieve net zero computing. 

The [scope of the project](/scope/) will cover all the **UKRI-owned and majority-funded digital research infrastructure.**

It will produce a clear **roadmap** for how UKRI can take action to reduce the carbon emissions from data generation, analysis, storage and dissemination from DRI. Led by the project team at the [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis](https://www.ceda.ac.uk), the project will study how the entire UKRI DRI estate can deliver **carbon neutral computing by 2040 or earlier.**
