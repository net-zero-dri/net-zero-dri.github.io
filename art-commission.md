## What are the aims for the work?

Â£25,000 of funding is available for an art commission piece that will be used to **inspire collective action towards sustainable digital research infrastructure.** <br>
The purpose of the online event is to **communicate the project's final recommendations** - about how to achieve net zero for digital research infrastructure - and encourage engagement with the roadmap across the UKRI community. <br>
We envisage the artwork design and making process will **stimulate conversations across the research community.** The artwork will be a talking point at the event in May, and beyond. We hope the artwork encourages people to look at the challenge from a fresh perspective, and inspire collective action.
