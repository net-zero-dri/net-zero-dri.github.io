We have two surveys that we need the research community to complete. They won't take long - and will help us to produce a roadmap for reaching net zero digital research infrastructure.

### Survey 1: motivators and barriers to sustainable digital research infrastructure

*Last chance to complete - closing on Friday 9 December!*

We want to understand how you make use of digital resources - [help us by filling in our survey](https://edgehillpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_erqaYxB9f2Y7bXU), it will only take 15 minutes. This survey will investigate the factors that motivate and those that act as barriers to the sustainable use of digital resources.

### Survey 2: research computing practices survey

The [UKRI Net Zero Digital Research Infrastructure Scoping Project](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/) aims to create a roadmap to achieving net zero computing by 2040. To that end, we need data on all digital research activity carried out with UKRI funding. 

We need your help to get an accurate view of the software practices applied and the hardware used by UKRI researchers. 

Please help us by [completing our questionnaire](https://forms.gle/b5NM9eSU8zoniNPR9) - it should take 10-15 minutes. It focuses on computing outside of UKRI facilities (local cluster, small servers, desktops). 

Please also consider passing this message on to any colleagues who run digital experiments, or anyone else you think we should hear from.

Thanks for taking the time to engage with this.
