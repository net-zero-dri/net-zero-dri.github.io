The UKRI Net Zero Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) Scoping project is a complex, multi-disciplinary project. This page describes the frequently asked questions. If you have any further questions, please [contact us](/contact/).

## Project scope   

**How will the project impact on UKRI decisions?** 

Our project will be making recommendations based on the evidence that we gather. What happens next is likely to depend on the strength of evidence, the degree of community engagement that we can demonstrate. The extent to which recommendations are well considered and practical, taking into account the complexity and distributed nature of UKRI decision making and their dependence on decisions made in Government. 

**What is Digital Research Infrastructure?**

You can find a description on the [UKRI website](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/).

**At what point do embodied emissions get considered?**  

Embodied emissions are the emissions associated with the supply chain. The project will consider these right from the start.  

For the data centres, it appears that this is a not the largest part of the emissions but it's still potentially significant - somewhere between 10 and 30%, so it is important. 

We need to consider it now because it's quite a challenging problem. We don't have a huge direct influence on the factories that are incurring these emissions, but we need to work on this. 

**Are you including UKRI IT staff, travel and offices in the scope?**  

Here we need to distinguish between DRI staff (who are running digital research infrastructures, like data centres) and IT staff (who are providing support for staff with their desktop or laptop computers and their office software). 

The staff travel of DRI staff is in scope. The IT staff, on the other hand, are out of scope. 

**What is the expected balance between (1) moving to net-zero sources, and (2) reducing consumption / increasing power efficiency?**  

We think this is about even - but that's based on not having enough evidence to make a more detailed estimate. There should also be an option (3) for carbon offsetting and capture. The potential role of offsetting and capture is also very unclear.  

Moving to net zero sources is dependent, to a certain extent, on what happens in the UK as a whole and in the supply change. Nationally there is an objective for the national grid to go to net zero, but it is not clear whether there is a strategy in place to make it happen. There is a clear will, but it will require many organisations to play a part, and we need to look at what part UKRI can play.
