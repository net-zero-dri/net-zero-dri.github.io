## Overview of scope of work
Different digital research infrastructure (DRI) stakeholders need help to understand and plan for meeting net zero challenges. Many of the skills and knowledge needed to solve net zero challenges are already in the community â€“ but we lack the mechanisms for sharing them and enabling behaviour change. <br>

Go Zero led a series of three participatory workshops with the aim to connect and enthuse the DRI community, empowering stakeholders to take ownership of the path to net zero. 

 Snowball sampling techniques were used to seek expressions of interest from 60 people across the UKRI and JISC DRI communities. A set of incentives were offered to encourage participation. Approximately half of those approached expressed an interest in participating via the first of four online surveys. Each 4 hour online workshop was designed to include three expert speakers to help frame the workshop discussion.

The workshpops explored 3 research questions: 
-  W1: Where does the energy consumption come from and how can it be made more efficient?
-  W2: What to do with the fossil fuel left over/how to limit unavoided emissions and what behaviour change solutions exist to meet climate targets?
-  W3: What are key actions (by 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040) to meet net zero targets?
