## Partnering up to reach net zero computing

Digital research infrastructure (DRI) ranges from supercomputers to data archives, from software to the people using and maintaining it. These infrastructures are essential for many scientific studies that are looking into the most pressing issues our society faces. Operating and using DRI has a carbon impact largely due to energy consumption and the embodied carbon from the manufacturing footprint of computer hardware. The carbon impact needs to be assessed across all of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) community if we are going to reach our net zero goals by 2040 (or sooner). This is a huge task that requires collaboration and partnerships to be formed across all UKRI sectors. The UKRI Net Zero DRI Scoping Project is building a community of experts to help tackle the task - XX researchers from XXX institutions have recently been made project partners. 

### About the scoping project
The UKRI Net Zero DRI Scoping Project is collecting robust evidence and formulating recommendations that ensure we can provide carbon neutral computing and data services for the research and innovation communities. Evidence collected during the 19-month project will cover all areas that influence net zero targets – ranging from policy decisions, procurement processes for hardware, changing behaviours of users and managers of DRI, and much more. Our scope covers all UKRI owned or majority funded DRI - this is spread across a range of organisations, including universities and research councils.

### Building a community of experts
Due to a vast scope and short timescales, and to increase the breadth of expertise and experience informing the project, the core project team has enlisted the help of partners across various organisations to help gather the necessary evidence. Some of the work being undertaken by project partners is summarised below. Funding for many of the partners was allocated via sandpit events which attracted new ideas from the community, while the consortium is put together to address problems identified in the original project funding call.

Dr Martin Juckes, the project lead, said “The target of net zero digital research infrastructure across UKRI is a massive challenge which will require both exploitation of emerging technologies and a transformation in the way we think about our use of resources. We are building a community of experts who will help contribute to our evidence based roadmap.” 

The work undertaken by project partners is being coordinated by the core project team, based at the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA). All evidence collected will be translated into recommendations that will ensure UKRI’s DRI can reach net zero. The final report is due for publication in Summer 2023. An interim report (including initial recommendations) will be published in Summer 2022.
