### Project Partner Webinars â€“ Findings and RecommendationsÂ Â 

We are holding two webinars to share the outcomes of work undertaken by our project partners. These pieces of work have been undertaken by over 40 researchers from 20 different institutions over the last ~6 months. Both webinars are intended to provide an opportunity for the wider research community to engage with and discuss the project outcomes.

**Please [register to attend here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/net-zero-dri-project-partners-webinars-registration-490456527677)**. 

The webinars have been divided according to two themes reflected in the findings and recommendations of the projects:Â Â 

* Webinar 1 - Technical and Operational ChallengesÂ 
* Webinar 2 - Community and Organisational ChallengesÂ 


Further details about the webinars below. Â 

#### Webinar 1: Technical and Operational Challenges, Tuesday 31 January 2-4pm (UK time)Â 

This webinar will cover technical and operational challenges such as: hardware procurement, design and architecture of infrastructure, cloud platforms, consolidation, power management and efficiency, end-of-life, and carbon capture and offsetting.Â 

Projects presenting are:Â Â 

* CarbonQuanDRI: developing a measurement trace capturing various sustainability aspects in the operation of a DRI service, including dependencies between different indicators (e.g. data flow, power consumption, and carbon intensity)Â 
* IRISCAST: auditing energy usage of the IRIS DRI via snap-hot data captureÂ Â 
* Energetic: exploring energy-to-solution consumption in High Performance Computing (HPC)Â Â 
* HPC-Jeep: informing efficient, environmentally conscientious use of HPC resources â€“ ARCHER2 and DiRACÂ Â 
* Mapping the DRI: collating a representative sample of the DRI using the UKRI InfraPortal  (tbc)Â 
* Case studies update â€“ detailed analysis for the following infrastructures: JASMIN, Archer2, Jade, Scafell PikeÂ Â 

#### Webinar 2: Community and Organisational Challenges, Thursday 2 February, 1:30-3:30pm (UK time)Â 

This webinar will cover community and organisational challenges such as: user facing services, data management, behaviour change, training, proportionality of energy use, the risks of negative impacts, and monitoring and driving change.Â 

Projects presenting are:Â Â 

* Arinzrit: mapping the DRI policy and practice landscapeÂ Â 
* Value: developing recommendations for evaluating carbon emissions vs output â€˜valueâ€™ to support UKRI decision-makingÂ Â 
* Go Zero: empowering the research community to take ownership of Net ZeroÂ Â 
* DRI User Behaviour Survey: identifying implicit attitudes to environmental sustainability and gathered information about existing sustainable usage of DRI
* Art to inspire collective action on sustainable digital research infrastructure: the progress so far and how you can get involvedÂ 

The rough structure of each webinar will be:Â Â 

* Introduction/recap from core project teamÂ 
* ~10 minutes per talk, followed by Q&A and plenty of time for discussionÂ Â 
* A summary from the core project team about â€˜what nextâ€™Â

#### Progress webinar - Friday 9th September at 11:30am (GMT)
We are hosting a webinar to share and discuss the findings of our first interim report.

Our [interim report has been published](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/reports/). The document shares recommendations from an extensive literature review and will form the basis of our Final Report, due to be released next summer.

This webinar will cover the following:
* The key recommendations from the interim report
* Discussion about the findings
* Information about future events and activities

Please [register to attend](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/webinar-net-zero-dri-scoping-project-registration-406802305647) the event. 


#### Go Zero Workshop Series - October/November 2022
One of our project partners, the Go Zero team, are hosting a series of three workshops in Autumn 2022 aimed at: 
* People who use digital research infrastructure, at any stage in their research / research-related career
* People who manage, maintain and operate digital research infrastructure
* People who fund digital research infrastructure

The online workshops are designed to:
* connect and enthuse the UK research community in order to meet the net zero challenge facing digital research infrastructure
* empower stakeholders to take ownership of the path to net zero 

Join us and benefit from a chance to shape the future of UKRIâ€™s net zero work, give your views, receive up to Â£190 in incentives, and network with others!
