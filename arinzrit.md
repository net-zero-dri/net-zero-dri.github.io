**What's the scope of this work?**

While technical factors have their place, creating a net zero digital research infrastructure (DRI) requires an understanding of the wider social and organisational factors which drive demand for it as well. 

This project aimed to map the broader landscape of: <br>
  - Interplay between policy and practice
  - Factors affecting growth for DRI
  - Risks and opportunities for answering questions about net zero
  - How DRI is shaped by socio-technical forces

25 interviews were conducted across stakeholder groups of users, providers, commissioners, and senior management relating to DRI. The interviewees spanned multiple disciplines, institutions, and research councils and, whilst not fully representative of the sector, capture a variety of experiences that point towards some of the complexities and relationships to be considered in moving towards Net Zero ambitions for DRI. These experiences also demonstrate that interventions should not just be technical. <br>
