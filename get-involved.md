## Who can contribute to the project 
The net-zero-dri project needs contributions from experts in the UK research community, industry partners and international stakeholders. 

We are collecting evidence to inform and provide recommendations for how UKRI's digital reseach infrastructure can reach net zero. This evidence will need to come from a broad range of areas. Including, but not limited to: computing architecture and hardware, social sciences (specifically related to behaviour change), environmental science, etc. 

## How to get involved? 
The evidence collected will take various forms, including direct quantitative evidence collected from current facilities, an extensive literature review, community workshops, proof-of-concept studies and other forms of expert consultation.
