**What's the scope of this work?** <br>

This project will develop a methodology to aid net zero decision making for UKRI in relation to Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI).This ‘net zero decision making’ is made up of:
- **Comparison:** the carbon emissions of a task vs. the ‘value’ it generates
- **Action:** assigning which tasks get to emit carbon via the use of UKRI electricity and infrastructure

The project will review how UKRI currently make decisions around DRI use (if, when and how a task gets to use DRI), undertake a literature review of how emissions-vs-value decisions have been managed in similar infrastructure environments, and provide specific recommendations to UKRI of a Net Zero decision-making methodology.
