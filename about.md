## What is the project about?

The net-zero-dri scoping poject will provide a clear roadmap for [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/) to deliver carbon neutral [digital research infrastructure (DRI)](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/) by 2040 or earlier. You can find out more in the [overview section](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/overview/) of this website. 


## Who is working on the project?

Staff from the [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)](http://www.ceda.ac.uk/). The core project team includes:
<p>Project Lead - Martin Juckes <br>
Project Manager - Jen Bulpett <br>
Science Officer - Charlotte Pascoe <br>
Communications - Poppy Townsend <br>
Technical lead - Ag Stephens <br></p>

The team will lead an initial, 18-month UKRI-wide study to survey the digital carbon landscape, run a set of demonstrators and develop a roadmap to ensure that UKRI's data infrastructure can achieve net zero. Taking a systems-based approach, CEDA will work to develop adaptation strategies for the way data is conserved, analysed and managed. 

## When will the project start/end?

The project started in September 2021 and will run for 18 months. 

## Who funded the project? 

£1.86 million was awarded to the project from the [Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)](https://nerc.ukri.org/), on behalf of UKRI
