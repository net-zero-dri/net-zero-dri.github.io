**The Interim Report is an extensive document but is split into manageable sections:**

**Executive Summary** – this summarises the projects recommendations (based on the findings in the rest of the report)

**Synthesis** – this section provides a synthesis of the key areas covered in the literature review, with links to more detailed discussion of individual papers in subsequent chapters.

**Introduction** – outlines the context and aims of the report/project

**Background** - this section frames the wider problem and provides context (based on literature)

**Key findings** – this expands on the details discussed in earlier chapters

## The project will produce two more reports:
* A 2nd interim report (due in early 2023) - this will provide initial recommendations based on the evidence collected by the project partners (such as the proof-of-concept studies)
* Final report (due in June 2023) - this will summarise all the evidence gathering activities undertaken by the project and provide final recommendations
