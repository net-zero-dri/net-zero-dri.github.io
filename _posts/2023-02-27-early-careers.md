_We want to engage future researchers, who will be most impacted by climate change, with our net zero digital research infrastructure roadmap_ 

We are hosting two workshops, aimed at early career researchers, which provide an opportunity to learn about environmental sustainability and the future of digital research.  

Decarbonising our lives, and more specifically the [digital research infrastructure](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/), will require a reassessment of existing habits, values and methodologies across the research community and wider society. We want to engage future researchers, who will be most impacted by climate change, with the net zero digital research infrastructure roadmap to ensure your voices are included and listened to.  

## Who can attend? 

We welcome attendance from anyone in their early career (or within 10 working years of undergrad) who is either doing or supporting research.  

You might be a PhD student, postdoc, support staff, research software engineer, librarian, lab technician - anyone either doing or supporting research. You may not be using digital research infrastructure currently, but you might expect to be using/working with DRI in the next 20 years. You may have an interest in learning more about UKRI’s environmental sustainability policies and be interested in contributing to the development of a net zero roadmap for digital research infrastructure. 

The only essential criteria is that you are in your early career.  

## At the workshops 

Attendees will [learn about a UKRI funded project](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/) tasked with creating a net zero roadmap for digital research infrastructure. There will be opportunity to discuss the implications, changes and barriers associated with the roadmap, and identify opportunities for how early career researchers can influence change at institutional levels.  

You will be able to share your thoughts with the team and help shape an important and timely UKRI roadmap. You will also be able to ask the team about their opinions on how net zero policies may impact research in the future.
