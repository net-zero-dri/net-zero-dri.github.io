_We invite the community to join an online workshop series which will be hosted by the [Go Zero team](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/go-zero/) (part of the UKRI Net Zero DRI project)._

The evidence collected from these online discussions will inform recommendations for how UKRI can reach net zero [digital research infrastructure](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/). 

The online workshops are designed to: 

* connect and enthuse the UK research community in order to meet the net zero challenge facing [digital research infrastructure](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/)
* empower stakeholders to take ownership of the path to net zero 

There are three different workshop which will take place at 13:00-17:00 on the following dates: 

* Wednesday 5th October 2022 
* Wednesday 19th October 2022 
* Wednesday 2nd November 2022 

## Why attend the workshops?  

Join us to benefit from a chance to shape the future of UKRI’s net zero work, give your views, receive up to £190 in incentives, and network with others! 

 
## What’s involved in each workshop? 

Each workshop has an overarching question that it is trying to answer. More detailed questions can be found [in the workshop agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dn9f0lu6wVo5w6wsZOrff6PGnc315CVM?usp=sharing), which are publicly available. 

Workshop key questions (these are all in relation to [digital research infrastructure](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/)):  
* WORKSHOP 1: Where does the energy consumption come from and how can it be made more efficient? 
* WORKSHOP 2: What to do with the fossil fuel left over/how to limit unavoided emissions and what behaviour change solutions exist to meet climate targets? 
* WORKSHOP 3: What are key actions (by 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040) to meet net zero targets? 

Attendees are expected to attend all three workshops in the series as each workshop builds upon the discussion in the previous one. However, get in touch if you’d like to attend but can’t do all of the dates, we may be able to accommodate you.  

## Who can attend?  

Everyone doing, supporting or enabling research uses digital infrastructure in some form. 

Examples range from large infrastructures like supercomputers or long-term data centres, to smaller scale digital tools and software that are used for analysing data or running code.  

These workshops are open to everyone. We want to involve people from across all research sectors (and [all nine research councils](https://www.ukri.org/councils/)), specifically: 
* People who use digital research infrastructure, at any stage in their research / research-related career 
* People who manage, maintain and operate digital research infrastructure 
* People who fund digital research infrastructure
