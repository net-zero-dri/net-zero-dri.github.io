## Who can contribute to the project? 
The net-zero-dri project needs contributions from experts in the UK research community, industry partners and international stakeholders. 

We are collecting evidence to inform and provide recommendations for how UKRI's digital reseach infrastructure can reach net zero. This evidence will need to come from experts across a broad range of areas, including, but not limited to: 
* research computing architecture and hardware
* social sciences (specifically related to behaviour change)
* environmental science
* etc. 

## How to get involved? 
The evidence collected will take various forms, including direct quantitative evidence collected from current facilities, an extensive literature review, community workshops, proof-of-concept studies and other forms of expert consultation.  

At present, you can contribute to the project by: 

**Tell us about relevant literature**

**Attend events**

The project team will host various workshops/webinars throughout the project. Workshops will also be hosted by members of the community. Details of these will be added to the [events webpage](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/events/) and sent to the mailing list. 

**Apply for funding - proof-of-concept studies and workshops**

There is funding available in the project for the research community to undertake proof-of-concept studies or host workshops. A sandpit event will be run in early 2022 to allocate funds. Further details will be circulated in due course.
