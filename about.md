## What is the project about?

The net-zero-dri scoping project will gather evidence to develop a clear roadmap for [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/) (UKRI) to deliver carbon neutral [digital research infrastructure (DRI)](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/digital-research-infrastructure/) by 2040 or earlier. 

You can find out more in the [overview](/overview/) and [project scope](/scope/) sections of this website. 


## Who is working on the project?

Staff from the [Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)](http://www.ceda.ac.uk/). The core project team includes:
<p>Project Lead - Martin Juckes <br>
Senior Project Manager - Jen Bulpett <br>
Project Manager - Katie Cartmell <br>
Science Officer - Charlotte Pascoe <br>
Communications - Poppy Townsend <br>
Technical lead - Ag Stephens <br>
Summer students (3 months) - Lucy Woodward and Sophie Mosselmans <br></p>

The team will lead an initial, 19-month UKRI-wide study to survey the digital carbon landscape, run a set of demonstrators and develop a roadmap to ensure that UKRI's data infrastructure can achieve net zero. Taking a systems-based approach, CEDA will work to develop adaptation strategies for the way data is conserved, analysed and managed. 

## When will the project start/end?

The project started in November 2021 and will run for 19 months. <br>
