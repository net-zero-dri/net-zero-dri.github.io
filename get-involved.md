## Who can contribute to the project? 
The net-zero-dri project needs contributions from experts in the UK research community, industry partners and international stakeholders. 

We are collecting evidence to inform and provide recommendations for how UKRI's digital reseach infrastructure can reach net zero. We do not see the net zero challenge as a purely technical problem. 

We also wish to address the patterns of user behaviour which can make efficient use of infrastructure and the kind of community engagement needed to overcome the immense challenges of a transition to a rigorous net zero target over a 15 to 20 year timescale. 

This evidence will therefore need to come from experts across a broad range of areas, including, but not limited to: 
* research computing architecture and hardware
* social sciences (specifically related to behaviour change)
* environmental science
* arts and humanities 
* etc. 

If you would like to get involved, but are not sure how/if your expertise fits in, please get in [touch](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk).

## How to get involved? 
The evidence collected will take various forms, including direct quantitative evidence collected from current facilities, an extensive literature review, community workshops, proof-of-concept studies and other forms of expert consultation.  

At present, you can contribute to the project by: 

**Apply for funding - proof-of-concept studies and workshops**

There is funding available in the project for the research community to undertake [proof-of-concept studies](/proof-of-concept/) or host [workshops](/workshops/). A sandpit event will be run in early 2022 to allocate funds. 

[Further details about the sandpit announcement of opportunity here](/sandpit/). Deadline to register your interest is 4pm on 25th April 2022.
