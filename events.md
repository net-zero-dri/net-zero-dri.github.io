## ðŸ“… Upcoming events

### Early career events: Environmental sustainability and the future of digital in research (March and April)
We are hosting two workshops, aimed at early career researchers, which provide an opportunity to learn about environmental sustainability and the future of digital research.  

We want to engage future researchers, who will be most impacted by climate change, with our net zero digital research infrastructure roadmap to ensure your voices are included and listened to. 

[Further information and to register.](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/news/early-careers/)

### Creative Workshops â€“ offline option (complete before end of February)

We have [commissioned artist Paul Millhouse-Smith](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/art-commission/) to deliver a large-scale art-work in response to the core ambitions - and challenges - associated with the net zero agenda. The final piece will inspire collective action and stimulate conversations surrounding the transition to net zero digital research infrastructure (DRI).  

As part of this commission, Paul facilitated four creative workshops and an offline creative worksheet to gather information that will inspire his final artwork and facilitate discussion. Decarbonising the digital research infrastructure will require a reassessment of existing habits, values and methodologies across the research community. 

This work is open to a wide range of people across UKRI who have an interest in digital research infrastructure and net zero. We want to bring different perspectives together and provide a space for people to be creative, and explore what they hold important in the context of a rapidly changing world. It offers an opportunity to engage critically and creatively with the environmental sustainability discussion.
 
Your participation via the worksheet and what you submit to us will be incredibly valuable, and will help inspire Paul for his final artwork. 
 
[Complete the offline creative worksheet, ideally by 5pm on Friday 24 February 2023](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AgO--MDlmshAhY4LEhFgPFelx-vzTH9E_CeyFdPkzlA/edit?usp=sharing). You may want to complete all of it in order (taking ~60 minutes) or you could pick and choose which exercises to complete.

### Project Partner Webinars â€“ January/February 2023

We are holding two webinars to share the outcomes of work undertaken by [our project partners](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/project-activities/). These pieces of work have been undertaken by over 40 researchers from 20 different institutions over the last ~6 months. Both webinars are intended to provide an opportunity for the wider research community to engage with and discuss the project outcomes.

### Creative Workshops â€“ January/February 2023

We have [commissioned artist Paul Millhouse-Smith](https://net-zero-dri.ceda.ac.uk/art-commission/) to deliver a large-scale art-work in response to the core ambitions - and challenges - associated with the net zero agenda. The final piece will inspire collective action and stimulate conversations surrounding the transition to net zero digital research infrastructure (DRI).  

As part of this commission, Paul is facilitating four creative workshops in January and February to gather information that will inspire his final artwork and facilitate discussion. Decarbonising the digital research infrastructure will require a reassessment of existing habits, values and methodologies across the research community. These workshops are therefore open to anyone working with DRI, including researchers within any and all disciplines and career stages. 

The workshopsÂ offer an opportunity to engage critically and creatively with the environmental sustainability discussion.

The online creative workshops will be held on the following dates, you only need to attend one: 
* Friday 27 January 1-4pm 
* Monday 30 January 1-4pm 
* Friday 3 February 10am-1pm 
* Tuesday 7 February 10am-1pm  
* There is also an option to participate offline
