title: Mapping the DRI
permalink: /mapping/
---

This work will develop plans for a database that will enable mapping of the entire UKRI DRI estate.
The team will look into using the code base of the UKRI Infraportal, potentially extending the level of detail to support aggregation of some key capabilities (e.g. FLOP rating, transistor count, power consumption). They will also look for compatibility with the TOP 500 and Green 500 lists.

Institutions involved: Scientific Computing Department within the Science and Technology Facilities Council (SCD STFC)
