## Can I contribute to the Net Zero project? 
The net-zero-dri project needs contributions from experts in the UK research community, industry partners and international stakeholders. 

We are **collecting evidence** to inform and **provide recommendations** for how UKRI's digital reseach infrastructure can reach net zero - which is more than a purely technical problem. 

We also wish to address the **patterns of user behaviour** which can make efficient use of infrastructure and the kind of community engagement needed to overcome the immense challenges of a transition to a rigorous net zero target over a 15 to 20 year timescale. 

This evidence will therefore need to come from experts across a broad range of areas, including, but not limited to: 
* research computing architecture and hardware
* social sciences (specifically related to behaviour change)
* environmental science
* arts and humanities 

If you would like to get involved, but are not sure how/if your expertise fits in, **please get in [touch!](mailto:support@ceda.ac.uk)**
