**What's the scope of this work?**

While technical factors have their place, creating a net zero digital research infrastructure (DRI) requires an understanding of the wider social and organisational factors which drive demand for it as well. 

This project aims to map the broader landscape of: <br>
  - Interplay between policy and practice
  - Factors affecting growth for DRI
  - Risks and opportunities for answering questions about net zero
  - How DRI is shaped by socio-technical forces
