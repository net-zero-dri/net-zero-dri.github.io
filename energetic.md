### Energetic = ENergy-aware hEteRoGenEous compuTIng at sCale

**What's the scope of the work?** <br>
Current, leading-edge high performancecomputing (HPC) systems are often heterogeneous, comprised of combinations of multiple compute units and accelerators, including (but not limited to) CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. HPC is a significant contributor to energy usage. However, the energy-to-solution varies between these architectures. In terms of minimising energy consumption, this choice of possible architectures presents various challenges to HPC managers and users. <br>

This project aims to test whether the use of heterogeneous architecture could significantly reduce the energy-to-solution and thus the energy consumed by UKRI digital research infrastructures. A workshop and other community engagements are planned involving key stakeholders to aid understanding the current state and enable dissemination of project findings of reducing energy consumption. <br>
