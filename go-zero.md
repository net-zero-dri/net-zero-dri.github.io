## Overview of scope of work
Different digital research infrastructure (DRI) stakeholders need help to understand and plan for meeting net zero challenges. Many of the skills and knowledge needed to solve net zero challenges are already in the community â€“ but we lack the mechanisms for sharing them and enabling behaviour change. <br>

This project will lead a series of participatory workshops which will be undertaken with the aim to connect and enthuse the DRI community in order to meet the net zero challenge. The workshops are designed to empower all stakeholders to take ownership of the path to net zero.
