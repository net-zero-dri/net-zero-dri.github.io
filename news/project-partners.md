## Partnering up to reach net zero computing

Digital research infrastructure (DRI) ranges from supercomputers to data archives, from software to the people using and maintaining it. These infrastructures are essential for many scientific studies that are looking into the most pressing issues our society faces. Operating and using DRI has a carbon impact largely due to energy consumption and the embodied carbon from the manufacturing footprint of computer hardware. The carbon impact needs to be assessed across all of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) community if we are going to reach our net zero goals by 2040 (or sooner). This is a huge task that requires collaboration and partnerships to be formed across all UKRI sectors. The UKRI Net Zero DRI Scoping Project is building a community of experts to help tackle the task - 18 institutions have recently been made project partners. 

### About the scoping project
The UKRI Net Zero DRI Scoping Project is collecting robust evidence and formulating recommendations that ensure we can provide carbon neutral computing and data services for the research and innovation communities. Evidence collected during the 19-month project will cover all areas that influence net zero targets – ranging from policy decisions, procurement processes for hardware, changing behaviours of users and managers of DRI, and much more. Our scope covers all UKRI owned or majority funded DRI - this is spread across a range of organisations, including universities and research councils.

### Building a community of experts
Due to a vast scope and short timescales, and to increase the breadth of expertise and experience informing the project, the core project team has enlisted the help of partners across various organisations to help gather the necessary evidence. Some of the work being undertaken by project partners is summarised below. Funding for many of the partners was allocated via sandpit events which attracted new ideas from the community, while the consortium is put together to address problems identified in the original project funding call.

Dr Martin Juckes, the project lead, said “The target of net zero digital research infrastructure across UKRI is a massive challenge which will require both exploitation of emerging technologies and a transformation in the way we think about our use of resources. We are building a community of experts who will help contribute to our evidence based roadmap.” 

The work undertaken by project partners is being coordinated by the core project team, based at the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA). All evidence collected will be translated into recommendations that will ensure UKRI’s DRI can reach net zero. The final report is due for publication in Summer 2023. An interim report (including initial recommendations) will be published in Summer 2022.

| Learning from the Big Picture: Applying Responsible Innovation to the Net Zero Research Infrastructure Transformation (ARINZRIT) | Creating a net zero digital research infrastructure needs an understanding not just of the technical factors, but also wider social and organisational factors which drive demand for it. By understanding the broader landscape of policy, practice and engagement with it, this project seeks to ‘map the landscape’ of how policies and practices interplay and affect growth in digital research infrastructure, providing key evidence at a ‘policy & cultural’ level, and identifying ‘risks’ and opportunities to start answering critical questions toward net zero. <br>The project will identify the ways in which socio-technical forces shape, and are shaped by, the<br>research infrastructures and their environmental impacts. It will suggest alternate ways in which these factors may shape the evolution of the infrastructures in the future, in line or exceeding expectations for net zero. Opportunities for impact reduction through intervention points in this system, how they might reduce infrastructure demand, and risks of potential unintended consequences from net zero initiatives will also be identified.<br>Reference document here (will be added here soon).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Lancaster University<br>University of Bristol <br>Science and Technology Facilities Council  <br>Edinburgh  University                                                                               |

Enabling good decision making therefore requires a source of accurate real-world data on infrastructure climate impacts.<br>This project will perform an audit of carbon costs across a multi-site heterogeneous infrastructure (called IRIS) by collecting and analysing snapshots of actual usage. It will identify where the carbon cost sits across the infrastructure. It will also find out what the drivers are that influence carbon cost.

HPC is a significant contributor to energy usage. However, the energy-to-solution varies between these architectures. In terms of minimising energy consumption, this choice of possible architectures presents various challenges to HPC managers and users. <br>Currently, there is little data on the energy efficiency of codes or algorithms across different architectures, a lack of an established framework for measuring this on new systems, and little use of existing tools like Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI) for measuring and comparing power draw from hardware. Due to this lack of data, it is difficult for DRI managers/users to effectively design codes and systems to meet quantifiable energy budgets that contribute to achieving net-zero goals.<br>This project aims to test whether the use of heterogeneous architecture could significantly reduce the energy-to-solution and thus the energy consumed by UKRI digital research infrastructures. A workshop and other community engagements are planned involving key stakeholders to aid understanding the current state and enable dissemination of project findings of reducing energy consumption.<br>Reference document here (will be added here soon).  | Manchester Metropolitan University  <br>Newcastle University <br>EPCC/University of Edinburgh<br>University College London                                                                           |
| HPC job efficiency and energy usage: monitoring and reporting (HPC-JEEP)                                                         | Traditionally, resources on high performance computing services have been granted in units of compute time (core-hours, node-hours, etc.) with users not informed, nor paying much attention to their energy use; and services not generally reporting breakdowns of energy use other than for total electricity charges. Without an understanding of how research areas, projects and users use energy and how efficiently they use resources it is difficult to plan future procurements or service strategies towards a net zero goal. <br>This project will look at what level of energy and efficiency information can be extracted from current and historical per-job data from ARCHER2 and DiRAC services; and how this data can be analysed and synthesised to provide the information required for funders (who procure and set service strategy and objectives) and researchers (who make decisions about how best to use the resources they are granted) to make informed decisions about how to manage HPC resources to extract the maximum research benefit in the most energy efficient way.<br>Reference document here (will be added here soon).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | University of Edinburgh <br>Durham University                                                                                                                                                        |
